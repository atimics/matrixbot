### ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

#### 1. PayloadBuilder Optimizations
**File**: `chatbot/core/world_state/payload_builder.py`

**Key Features**:
- **Adaptive Configuration**: New `optimize_for_size` flag enabling/disabling optimizations
- **Reduced Default Limits**: 
  - Messages per channel: 10 â†’ 8
  - Action history: 5 â†’ 4
  - Thread messages: 5 â†’ 4
  - Other channels: 3 â†’ 2
  - Message snippet length: 75 â†’ 60 chars

**Message Optimization**:
```python
# Compact message format
{
    "id": msg.id,
    "sender": msg.sender_username or msg.sender,
    "content": msg.content[:60] + "..." if len(msg.content) > 60 else msg.content,
    "timestamp": msg.timestamp,
    "fid": msg.sender_fid,
    "reply_to": msg.reply_to,
    "has_images": bool(msg.image_urls),
    "power_badge": msg.metadata.get("power_badge", False)
}
```

**Channel Optimization**:
```python
# Compact channel format
{
    "id": ch_data.id,
    "type": ch_data.type,
    "name": ch_data.name[:30] + "..." if len(ch_data.name) > 30 else ch_data.name,
    "recent_messages": messages_for_payload,
    "last_activity": timestamp_range["end"] if timestamp_range else ch_data.last_checked,
    "msg_count": len(messages_for_payload),
    "priority": "detailed" if is_primary else "secondary"
}
```

#### 2. Smart Data Filtering

- Only include tools with multiple cached results
- Limit to 3 most recent results per tool
- Compact metadata format

**Search Cache Optimization**:
- Limit to 3 most recent searches
- Essential metadata only

**Memory Bank Optimization**:
- Only include platforms with 2+ memories
- Limit to recent memories per user

**Thread Optimization**:
- Only include threads active in last 2 hours
- Limit to 3 most active threads

#### 3. Node System Enhancements
**Enhanced Node Path Generation**:
- Intelligent filtering of node paths
- Only create nodes for substantial data
- Reduced memory footprint for node traversal

**Optimized Data Extraction**:
- Compact user data representation
- Truncated bios and content
- Essential fields only

#### 4. Integration Updates

**Processing Hub Integration**:
**File**: `chatbot/core/orchestration/processing_hub.py`

```python
config = {
    "optimize_for_size": True,
    "include_detailed_user_info": False,
    "max_messages_per_channel": 8,
    "max_action_history": 4,
    "max_thread_messages": 4,
    "max_other_channels": 2,
    "message_snippet_length": 60
}
```

**AI Engine Updates**:

    "include_detailed_user_info": False,    # Compact user data
    "max_messages_per_channel": 8,          # Reduced from 10
    "max_action_history": 4,                # Reduced from 5  
    "max_thread_messages": 4,               # Reduced from 5
    "max_other_channels": 2,                # Reduced from 3
    "message_snippet_length": 60,           # Reduced from 75
    "bot_fid": "...",                       # Bot identification
    "bot_username": "..."                   # Bot identification
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
