# DEPRECATED: main_with_ui.py has been consolidated into main.py
# 
# To run the chatbot with UI, use:
#   python -m chatbot.main --with-ui
#
# To run the chatbot standalone, use:
#   python -m chatbot.main
#
# This file was deprecated on 2025-06-21 during consolidation

# If you need the old behavior, use:
# python -m chatbot.main --with-ui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
