# Event-Driven AI Bot System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We've Built

You asked for an event-driven architecture where the main loop is triggered by changes to world state rather than polling, and that's exactly what we've delivered.

### Core Architecture

```
world_state_changes -> AI_decision -> action_execution -> world_state_update -> (repeat on changes)
```

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Event Orchestrator** (`event_orchestrator.py`)
   - Main coordination loop that detects world state changes
   - Triggers AI decision cycles only when state hash changes
   - Supports scheduled observations (configurable interval)
   - Rate limiting and error handling

2. **World State Management** (`world_state.py`)
   - Tracks messages from all channels
   - Maintains action history
   - System status monitoring
   - JSON serialization for AI consumption

3. **AI Decision Engine** (`ai_engine.py`)
   - Uses OpenRouter API for decisions
   - Structured JSON in/JSON out communication
   - Maximum 3 actions per cycle
   - Priority-based action selection

4. **Action Executor** (`action_executor.py`)
   - Executes AI-selected actions
   - Supports Matrix and Farcaster actions
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

5. **Observers**
   - **Matrix Observer** (`matrix_observer.py`) - Monitors Matrix channels
   - **Farcaster Observer** (`farcaster_observer.py`) - Monitors Farcaster feeds

### Event-Driven Features

✅ **State Change Detection**: System calculates hashes of world state and only acts when changes occur
✅ **No Polling**: The main loop responds to events, not continuous polling
✅ **Clock Events Ready**: Architecture supports adding scheduled triggers later
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Configurable maximum cycles per hour
✅ **JSON Communication**: Clean structured data exchange with AI
✅ **Multi-Platform**: Both Matrix and Farcaster support
✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging throughout all components

## 🔄 How the Event Loop Works

1. **Observation Phase**: Scheduled checks for new messages (configurable interval)
2. **Change Detection**: Calculate world state hash, compare with previous
3. **AI Decision**: If state changed, trigger AI to analyze and select actions
4. **Action Execution**: Execute up to 3 AI-selected actions
5. **State Update**: Record action results in world state
6. **Repeat**: Wait for next state change or scheduled observation

## 🚀 Ready to Run

The system is complete and tested:

- ✅ All components pass unit tests (`test_system.py`)
- ✅ Demo shows complete event cycle (`demo.py`)
- ✅ Configuration template provided (`.env.example`)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (`README.md`)

## 🔧 Configuration

Simply copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- OpenRouter API key for AI decisions
- Matrix credentials
- Farcaster API key (optional)
- Monitoring targets and rate limits
